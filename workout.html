  <b><center><h3 style="color:Yellow;"> Sip Water Throughout The Day</h3></center></b>
	<b><i><p style="color:White;">Hydration is an often overlooked element of prepping for a workout, but it's a must particularly if you train intensely. "Hydration is a key factor in being able to push yourself to the limit," says Dymatize athlete Lawrence Ballenger. "You'll lose roughly 10 percent of your strength from being dehydrated." Studies have shown that even mild dehydration can also negatively impact your mood, mental acuity, and energy level—even if you don't feel thirsty. </p></i></b>	
	<center><img src=tip1.jpg alt="tip1" style="width:60%;"></center>
	<b><i><p style="color:White;">Many people walk around all day long without realizing they're in a partially dehydrated state. The best way to avoid this is to make a water bottle a fixture in your life at home, on the road, at work—everywhere. Make sure you're sipping it throughout the day, so your tank is full when it comes time to train.

Quality intra-workout blends such as Dymatize's AminoPro contain electrolytes to help your body hold on to water during long workouts. If you've been debating whether to use an intra-workout supplement like BCAAs, consider this a point in their favor as well.

Remember: If you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated. At that point, stop sipping and get gulping, because gulping speeds up the rate at which your body absorbs water. Your best bet is to keep from becoming dehydrated in the first place!</p></i></b>
	<b><i><center><h3 style="color:Yellow;"> Stay Seated</h3></center></i></b>
	<b><i><p style="color:White;">If you typically perform isolation exercises such as curls, overhead triceps extensions, and lateral raises while standing, switch things up. Next time, try doing them while seated. </p></i></b>
	<center><img src=tip3.jpg alt="stay seated" style="width:60%;"></center>
	<b><i><p style="color:White;">Sitting will help ensure you aren't using any momentum to help fuel the movement, like swinging your arms back and forth with each biceps curl. You'll immediately find that you're able to focus far more effectively on performing a slow, controlled movement. Hello, pump!

This goes in the other direction, too. If you're always parked on your can in front of the dumbbell rack, stand up. Doing the same thing in a different way is a great technique to shake off a slump and give your body a fresh stimulus. Never stop growing! 
</p></i></b>
	<center><h3 style="color:Yellow;"> Pick Your Pre-Workout Carefully </h3></center>	
	<b><i><p style="color:White;">Quick: What's the most important ingredient in your pre-workout? If you're like most people, you'll say something like caffeine or beta-alanine, since these two ingredients are great at making you feel energized at the start of your workout—particularly in caffeine's case—and helping you survive a grueling heap of reps.

But let's be honest: In a great workout, you do more than just survive. You thrive! Try a product that boosts blood flow to produce a stronger muscle pump and improve endurance. Don't just push through sets; push blood into muscles!

Lawrence favors Dymatize M.P.ACT before his hardest sessions, since it backs up its caffeine and beta-alanine content with pump-boosting ingredients like agmatine sulfate, beet root extract, and an exclusive high-polyphenolic pomegranate extract. </p></i></b>
